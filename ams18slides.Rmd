## Assumptions/Motivations

> - Consistency is more important than conformity.
> - A consistent zone need not be rectangular, but should be convex.
> - Consistency *within* a game is important.
> - Different zones for LH and RH batters are OK.
> - One egregiously bad call is worse/as bad as several marginally bad calls.

## Define established ball and strike zones

## Established Strike Zone: Convex Hull

Let $H_l$ denote the open half-plane bounded by the line $l$. The convex hull of a set of points $P$ is the set

$$ S = \bigcap_{\{H_l \mid H_l \cap P = \emptyset\}} H_l^c$$

When $P$ contains the locations of all called strikes, $S$ is the \textit{established strike zone}.

## Established Ball Zone: $\alpha$-Shape?

For $\alpha>0$, let $B_{x,\alpha}$ denote the open ball in $\mathbb{R}^2$ of radius $\alpha$ centered at the point $x$.  Given a set of points $P \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, two points $p_1, p_2 \in \mathbb{R}^2$ are \textit{$\alpha$-neighbors} if $p_1$ and $p_2$ lie on the boundary of some $B_{x,\alpha}$ such that $B_{x,\alpha}\cap P = \emptyset$.  

The \textit{$\alpha$-shape} is the straight line graph formed by drawing line segments between $\alpha$-neighbors.

- $\alpha$-neighbors are close together but next to big empty regions.
- The $\alpha$-shape is the outline of the points $P$. 
- Does not need to be convex or even simply-connected.
- For large $\alpha$, the $\alpha$-shape is the boundary of the convex hull.

## Established Ball Zone: $\alpha$-Hull

For $\alpha>0$, let $B_{x,\alpha}$ denote the open ball in $\mathbb{R}^2$ of radius $\alpha$ centered at the point $x$.  Given a set of points $P \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, the \textit{$\alpha$-hull} of $P$ is the set 
$$ X = \bigcap_{\{B_{x,\alpha} \mid B_{x,\alpha} \cap P = \emptyset\}} B_{x,\alpha}^c$$

When $P$ contains the locations of all called balls, $X$ is the \textit{established ball zone}.

- Approaches convex hull $S = \bigcap_{\{H_l \mid H_l \cap P = \emptyset\}} H_l^c$ as $\alpha\rightarrow \infty$.
- Intuitively: hole punch.
- May not be simply connected for smallish $\alpha$.

## Inconsistency Index Metric

$S =$ established strike zone (convex hull of strikes) 

$X =$ established ball zone ($\alpha$-hull of balls)

$$
\mbox{inconsistency} = \frac{\mbox{balls in } S + \mbox{strikes in } X}{\mbox{total calls}}
$$
  
> - This is a \textit{per game} metric. 
> - Compute separately for right-hand batters and left-hand batters and add. 

## Choosing $\alpha$

 - $\alpha$ too small: Ball zone has lots of components
 - $\alpha$ too large: Seems unfair to umpires
 - $\alpha$ way too large: Ball zone becomes simply connected
 - $\alpha = 0.5539$: $1/3$ rule-book zone width

## Correlations
```{r, comment=NA,echo=2}
umpMetrics <- readRDS("metricsforslides.Rda")
round(cor(umpMetrics),2)
```

## Correlations: observations

```{r, comment=NA,echo=FALSE}
umpMetrics <- readRDS("metricsforslides.Rda")
round(cor(umpMetrics),2)
```

> - Walk rate uncorrelated to inconsistency, accuracy.
> - Smaller zones tend to be more accurate and consistent.
> - Inconsistency is moderately correlated with accuracy.
